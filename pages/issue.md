Understanding the many components of food security as an issue is important in understanding its impacts and potential solutions to communities. Often, its existence and effects can be invisible to members of the community; which is why more awarness is needed even in realitively food-stable areas.

When all people at all times have access to succificent, safe, nutritious food to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle.

## What does this mean?
In general, when understanding food security, it can be best examined in four different "components":
- **Availability**: Examines the 'supply-side' of food production, in short, does the food exist?
- **Access**: Understand whether people have the necessary incomes/other resources to acquire foodstuffs of adquate quality, in short, is the food affordable?
- **Utilization**: Focus on how the body makes use of the nutrients in food-- does the food available provide a healthy source of nutrition?
- **Stability**: Insecurity still exists if Availability, Access, and Utilization do not exist at all times.

## Insecurity in our backyard
Data from [Feeding America](https://feedingamerica.org) paints a partial picture of where food security exists here in the United States. Among other counties in Pennsylvania, Centre county ranks among one of the lower rates of food insecurity.

Even still, 13,660 of Centre County residents are food insecure on some level. The United Nations as part of its [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org) sets a target to:

<h6>SDG #2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutirition and promote sustainable agriculture</h6>

...and Centre County still falls short by 13,660. Additionally, data from Feeding America maintains that ~$8 million in additional funding is needed to sufficiently address food insecurity in our neighborhoods. That's ~$8 million that many residens don't realize is needed for struggling members of their communities.
