Understanding the many components of food security as an issue is important in understanding its impacts and potential solutions to communities. 

## Food security, defined
<h4 class="definition">food se·cu·ri·ty</h4>
<i>When all people at all times have access to succificent, safe, nutritious food to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle.</i>

## What does this mean?
In general, when understanding food security, it can be best examined in four different "components":
- **Availability**: Examines the 'supply-side' of food production, in short, does the food exist?
- **Access**: Understand whether people have the necessary incomes/other resources to acquire foodstuffs of adquate quality, in short, is the food affordable?
- **Utilization**: Focus on how the body makes use of the nutrients in food-- does the food available provide a healthy source of nutrition?
- **Stability**: Insecurity still exists if Availability, Access, and Utilization do not exist at all times.

## Insecurity in our backyard
Data from [Feeding America](https://feedingamerica.org) paints a partial picture of where food security exists here in the United States. Among other counties in Pennsylvania, Centre county ranks among one of the lower rates of food insecurity.
