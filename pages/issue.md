Understanding the many components of food security as an issue is important in understanding its impacts and potential solutions to communities. Often, its existence and effects can be invisible to members of the community; which is why more awarness is needed even in realitively food-stable areas.

When all people at all times have access to succificent, safe, nutritious food to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle.

## What does this mean?
In general, when understanding food security, it can be best examined in four different "components":
- **Availability**: Examines the 'supply-side' of food production, in short, does the food exist?
- **Access**: Understand whether people have the necessary incomes/other resources to acquire foodstuffs of adquate quality, in short, is the food affordable?
- **Utilization**: Focus on how the body makes use of the nutrients in food-- does the food available provide a healthy source of nutrition?
- **Stability**: Insecurity still exists if Availability, Access, and Utilization do not exist at all times.

## Exigence as a problem
Primarily, food insecurity exists as problem because of systematic issues that allow for food insecurity to persist in our communities. More specifically, in State College, PA:
1. Cycles of household insecurity as part of government-provided food benefits
2. Food waste driven by household and institution use
3. Lack of necessary education coupled with university dining options

### 1. Cycles of household insecurity
Food security is a complex issue to understand as the result of its role in our lives everyday. Insecurity for someone may look entirely different from person to person. Consider the following scenarios:

> You're a full-time college student who works part-time to help offset the cost of your education. After your classes, you head straight to your part-time job to get working right away. While there, you eat free food provided for you as part of your employer's discount for employees since it's available, and you don't have time to grab anything else. Are you food insecure?
> Your guardian works full-time and qualifies for SNAP benefits through the government. If they receive a promotion in a few months, their salary will increase and you will no longer be eligible for SNAP benefits. Are you food insecure?
> The prices of higher-quality, non-GMO, organic food products has risen to a level above your reasonable purchasing power. You have started to purchase alternatives that are less nutritious in an effort to stretch your dollars further. Are you food insecure?

Depending on your interpretation, the individuals in these scenarios may or may not meet the definition of being food insecure. 

In Pennsylvania, to be eligible for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits as a single person with no depedents, you must "...have a current bank balance (savings and checking combined) under $2,001..." according to [benefits.gov](https://www.benefits.gov/benefit/1169). The reality of a stagnant limit for many households is that benefits are not sufficiently allocated; individuals in a variety of circumstances (like some of those above) can teeter on the edge of qualification, and not recieive benefits they might realistically need. Conversely, other individuals who meet these requirements might not need this government-provided benefit in which they qualify. 

### 2. Generated food waste 


## Insecurity in our backyard
Data from [Feeding America](https://feedingamerica.org) paints a partial picture of where food security exists here in the United States. Among other counties in Pennsylvania, Centre county ranks among one of the lower rates of food insecurity.

Even still, 13,660 of Centre County residents are food insecure on some level. The United Nations as part of its [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org) sets a target to:

<h4>#2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutirition and promote sustainable agriculture</h4>

...and Centre County still falls short by 13,660. Additionally, data from Feeding America maintains that ~$8 million in additional funding is needed to sufficiently address food insecurity in our neighborhoods. That's ~$8 million that many residens don't realize is needed for struggling members of their communities.
