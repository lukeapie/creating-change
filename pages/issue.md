Understanding the many components of food security as an issue is important in understanding its impacts and potential solutions to communities. 

## Food security, defined
<h3 style="margin-bottom: -1rem"><i>food se·cu·ri·ty</i></h3>
When all people at all times have access to succificent, safe, nutritious food to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle.

## What does this mean?
In general, when understanding food security, it can be best examined in four different "components":
- **Availability**: Examines the 'supply-side' of food production, in short, does the food exist?
- **Access**: Understand whether people have the necessary incomes/other resources to acquire foodstuffs of adquate quality, in short, is the food affordable?
- **Utilization**: Focus on how the body makes use of the nutrients in food-- does the food available provide a healthy source of nutrition?
- **Stability**: Insecurity still exists if Availability, Access, and Utilization do not exist at all times.

## Insecurity in our backyard
Data from [Feeding America](https://feedingamerica.org) paints a partial picture of where food security exists here in the United States. Among other counties in Pennsylvania, Centre county ranks among one of the lower rates of food insecurity.

Even still, 13,660 of Centre County residents are food insecure on some level. The United Nations as part of its [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org) sets a target for:

  <div class="cell cell--2" style="background-color: #C8901F">
  	<h3 style="opacity: 0.3">2</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="cell cell--5" style="background-color: #C8901F">
  	<h3 style="color: #fff">End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutirition and promote sustainable agriculture</h3>
  </div>
</div>

...and Centre County still falls short by 13,660.
