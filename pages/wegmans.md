As a New York-based retailer, Wegmans Food Markets has been working to push zero-waste initiatives into its stores; one of the key components of reducing [Food Insecurity](https://lukeapie.github.io/creating-change/issue). The retailer says it follows a three-pronged approach of "reduce, reuse, recycle". 

## Food Recovery Hierarchy
As part of a national effort to reduce the leading cause of food waste, the United States [Environmental Protection Agency](https://epa.gov) (EPA) has developed sets of sustainable goals to address these concerns.

A five-tiered approach, from the "most preferred" to the "least preferred" was created by the EPA to outline how we should handle food waste. 

From [its website](https://www.epa.gov/sustainable-management-food/food-recovery-hierarchy), "The top levels of the hierarchy are the best ways to prevent and divert wasted food because they create the most benefits for the environment, society and the economy."

## Role as a retailer
With these goals in mind, retailier Wegmans has established its waste-eliminating guidelines as outlined by the EPA. 

From their efforts beginning in 2016, most notably, Wegmans has rolled out these sustainablilty iniatives company-wide to help reduce food waste in the communities inw hich they operate.

With a presence here in State College, PA, this effect is felt in our local community, too. 

According to their [sustainability website](https://www.wegmans.com/values-in-action/sustainability-at-wegmans/), Wegmans has donated 26.8 million pounds of food (perishable and nonperishable) through these corporate responsibility efforts in 2021.

> Wegmans self-reports donating 14.5 million pounds of product in 2017.

### Food diversion initiatives
From a [corporate press release](https://www.wegmans.com/news-media/press-releases/at-wegmans-reducing-waste-is-a-win-for-the-community-environment-and-the-company/) from 2018, Wegmans food diversion programs following a multi-faceted approach:
1. Produce not meeting appaerance requirements is used in other operations, like prepared foods with prepackaged products
2. Partnerships with food pantries and food banks means unsellable product can be donated and used by those organizations
3. Food scraps are used in applications with livestock where these other uses may not apply
4. Use in composting and use in alternative fueling if these other areas do not apply
