## My Creating Change Project
Understanding where Food Insecurity exists is the first step in recovering from the issues it can have on the communities in which we live. For my project for INTAG 100N, I wanted to create a website for education that helps identify food insecurity in our backyards, State College, PA.

Simply because an area has the appearence of being wealthy doesn't mean food insecurity isn't prevalent in those areas. My project hopes to:
1. Recognize Food Insecurity exists in all areas
2. Understand the issue of Food Insecurity through education
3. Recognize the effects on the population, "why" you should care
4. Point interested parties in the direction of solutions
