  	<p>Hi, I'm Luke!</p>
  	<p>This is my Creating Change Project for International Agriculture 100N: Everyone Eats: Hunger, Food Security & Global Agriculture. Thanks for being here.</p>
  	<p>I'm a first-year degree-seeking undergraduate here at the Pennsylvania State University from Wexford, Pennsylvania. My interest areas are within the Smeal College of Business here at Penn State, and I've been spreading my wings a little in an agriculture class this semester.</p>

This project is supposed to take the semester-long coursework we've completed beyond simply understanding the material in theory. I've chosen the (limited) HTML knowledge that I had to create an informative website about food insecurity here in the Centre County area. 

Before taking INTAG 100N, I had no idea that food insecure households could exist right under our noses in what is a well-educated and wealthier area of our Commonwealth. 

It is my hope that in creating a website available generally, having educational information and solutions available in one place would be useful to those people. Enjoy the website, and reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/@lukeapie) if you have any questions, or anything else.
