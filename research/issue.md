Understanding the many components of food security as an issue is important in understanding its impacts and potential solutions to communities. Often, its existence and effects can be invisible to members of the community; which is why more awarness is needed even in realitively food-stable areas.

When all people at all times have access to succificent, safe, nutritious food to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle.

## What does this mean?
In general, when understanding food security, it can be best examined in four different "components":
- **Availability**: Examines the 'supply-side' of food production, in short, does the food exist?
- **Access**: Understand whether people have the necessary incomes/other resources to acquire foodstuffs of adquate quality, in short, is the food affordable?
- **Utilization**: Focus on how the body makes use of the nutrients in food-- does the food available provide a healthy source of nutrition?
- **Stability**: Insecurity still exists if Availability, Access, and Utilization do not exist at all times.

## Exigence as a problem
Primarily, food insecurity exists as problem because of systematic issues that allow for food insecurity to persist in our communities. More specifically, in State College, PA:
1. Cycles of household insecurity as part of government-provided food benefits
2. Food waste driven by household and institution use
3. Lack of necessary education around responsible and sustainable consumption

## Insecurity in our backyards
Data from [Feeding America](https://feedingamerica.org) paints a partial picture of where food security exists here in the United States. Among other counties in Pennsylvania, Centre County ranks among one of the lower rates of food insecurity:

Even still, 13,660 of Centre County residents are food insecure on some level. The United Nations as part of its [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org) sets a target to

<h4>#2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutirition and promote sustainable agriculture</h4>

...and Centre County still falls short by 13,660. Additionally, data from Feeding America maintains that ~$8 million in additional funding is needed to sufficiently address food insecurity in our neighborhoods. That's ~$8 million that many residens don't realize is needed for struggling members of their communities.

### 1. Cycles of household insecurity
Food security is a complex issue to understand as the result of its role in our lives everyday. Insecurity for someone may look entirely different from person to person. Consider the following scenarios:

> You're a full-time college student who works part-time to help offset the cost of your education. After your classes, you head straight to your part-time job to get working right away. While there, you eat free food provided for you as part of your employer's discount for employees since it's available, and you don't have time to grab anything else. Are you food insecure?
<br>

> Your guardian works full-time and qualifies for SNAP benefits through the government. If they receive a promotion in a few months, their salary will increase and you will no longer be eligible for SNAP benefits. Are you food insecure?
<br>

> The prices of higher-quality, non-GMO, organic food products has risen to a level above your reasonable purchasing power. You have started to purchase alternatives that are less nutritious in an effort to stretch your dollars further. Are you food insecure?

Depending on your interpretation, the individuals in these scenarios may or may not meet the definition of being food insecure. 

In Pennsylvania, to be eligible for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits as a single person with no depedents, you must be both a resident and "...have a current bank balance (savings and checking combined) under $2,001..." according to [benefits.gov](https://www.benefits.gov/benefit/1169). 

The reality of a stagnant limit for many households is that benefits are not sufficiently allocated; individuals in a variety of circumstances, like some of those above, can teeter on the edge of qualification, and not recieive benefits they might realistically need. Conversely, other individuals who meet these requirements might not need this government-provided benefit in which they qualify for a variety of reasons.

Of [Centre County in 2020](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CBR42027PAA647NCEN), 7,161 residents were the recipients of government-provided supplemental nutrition benefits. By the numbers in Pennsylvania:

  	<p>of SNAP recipients are in households with children.</p>

</div>

*Data from the [Center on Policy and Budget Priorities](https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/a-closer-look-at-who-benefits-from-snap-state-by-state-fact-sheets#Pennsylvania)*

As part of this $2,001 baseline in Pennsylvania, households who might have never needed to consider SNAP benefits like during the COVID-19 pandemic with job losses might have not taken advantage of these resources available to them. These inflexbile baselines for certain individuals might have also meant foregoing a promotion or pay rise with the fear of no longer qualifying for nutrition assistance, and leaving themselves significantly undercovered.

What results is a system of inescapable food insecurity that both individuals and households can struggle to climb out of for a variety of these factors. 

### 2. Generated food waste 
In addition to food insecurity created as the result of government systematic inefficiencies, a contributuing factor to food insecurity for many households is food that is taken from the general supply and wasted by households and organizations.

It is estimated that 30-40% of all food products are ultimately thrown out by sellers or consumers that would be adequate to consume otherwise.

    <p>The cost to households is ~$1,866 in food which will never be consumed; shorting families and those who could use the extra nutrition.</p>

That money is used where it's needed, too. Penn State researchers also found that food waste is the lowest among households who already recive supplemental nutrition benefits from the government, too.

From the article, Penn State researches found that:
> *"Based on our estimation, the average American household wastes 31.9% of the food it acquires...More than two-thirds of households in our study have food-waste estimates of between 20% and 50%. However, even the least wasteful household wastes 8.7% of the food it acquires."*
<br>

> *"A household of two may not eat an entire head of cauliflower, so some could be wasted, whereas a larger household is more likely to eat all of it, perhaps at a single meal."*

*-- Edward Jaenicke, professor of agricultural economics at Penn State University*

The research is clear: households **and** businesses are both to blame for our food waste problem, and it's an issue that we can fix through a change in our behaviors.

Fundamentally, both businesses and American households need to reduce the waste they're producing. With enough food-insecure individuals that exist in our communities, these wasted food items have the potential to significantly improve the circumstances of struggling neighbors. 

Consider our own community at Penn State; most on-campus students eat meals in a buffet-style cafeteria. Have you ever thought, "It's no extra cost to me, might as well grab another one. I might want it in a minute." I have, too. 

Here on-campus, Penn State wastes **455,000 pounds of food a semester** from [thinking similar to this](https://www.collegian.psu.edu/news/campus/food-waste-from-campus-dining-commons-could-feed-fans-of-four-sold-out-penn-state/article_e7477c52-bf72-11e7-bf44-273401e7ee3e.html). 

13,660 people in our Centre County community are considered food insecure, and we throw away enough of our dining hall meals to feed all of Beaver Stadium four times over. Families in our local community shouldn't be going hungry when more than plenty is available. This is a systematic failure driven by consumer and institutional behavior.
